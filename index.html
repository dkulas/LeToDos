		**ATTN**  DOES NOT WORK IN PRIVATE BROWSING
		<br><br>
		This website was built using localStorage.  According to MDN: "The localStorage property allows you to access a local Storage object. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage. The only difference is that, while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the browsing session endsâ€”that is, when the browser is closed."<br><br>
		We can do better:  localStorage uses browser technology (Chrome, FireFox for example) to store information on a users' behalf.  But, and this is a BIG 'but', the information you enter into localStorage will only be available/accessible/reachable on the device you originally entered the information in.  So, if you enter information into localStorage via this website using your smartphone, you will NOT be able to access it on your tablet/laptop/desktop/etc and vice versa.
